This PR addresses the Vercel deployment problems to ensure the website works fully as a static site.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated vercel.json to properly serve all static files without routing conflicts
- Changed all HTML asset paths from relative to absolute URLs (e.g., href="/assets/css/main.css")
- Ensured sitemap.xml and robots.txt are accessible at root URLs
- Maintained all existing functionality and design integrity

**Files Modified:**
- vercel.json: Simplified configuration for static builds
- All HTML files: Updated CSS, JS, and image paths to absolute URLs

**Expected Results:**
- Homepage loads fully styled (no plain text)
- sitemap.xml and robots.txt accessible without 404 errors
- All assets load correctly on Vercel
